# dude8

dude8 is a minimalist Discord bot for tracking due dates and reminding the server of upcoming due dates.
Primarily intended for use in school Discord channels.

## Roadmap
[Public Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/3MYnaphu/public-roadmap)
- v0.1 Will contain the base functionality to let dude8 work. The only working commands will be: ``add``, ``bulkadd``, and ``remove``. 
This will be barely usable but should be stable, and function.
